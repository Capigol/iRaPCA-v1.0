ðŸ“ŒAbout Us

We are a drug discovery team with an interest in the development of publicly available open-source customizable cheminformatics tools
to be used in computer-assisted drug discovery. We belong to the Laboratory of Bioactive Compounds Research and Development (LIDeB) of the
National University of La Plata (UNLP), Argentina. Our research group is focused on computer-guided drug repurposing and rational discovery
of new drug candidates to treat epilepsy and neglected tropical diseases.

**iRaPCA WebApp**

iRaPCA Clustering is a clustering strategy based on an iterative combination of the random subspace approach (feature bagging), dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the k-means algorithm. The optimal number of clusters k and the best subset of descriptors are selected from plots of silhouette coefficient against different k values and subsets. Different validation metrics can be downloaded once the process has finished. A number of graphs may be built and readily downloaded through a simple click.
